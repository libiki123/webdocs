# R3

## Unity Reactive Programming Library

R3 is a powerful reactive programming library for Unity that implements the core concepts of ReactiveX. It provides a clean and efficient way to handle asynchronous data streams and event-based programming in Unity applications.

- [Official R3 Documentation](https://github.com/Cysharp/R3)

## Key Features

- Reactive programming paradigm for Unity
- Efficient memory management with pooling system
- Comprehensive set of reactive operators
- Unity-specific optimizations
- Strong type safety
- Minimal garbage collection overhead

## When to Use R3

- Event handling and communication between components
- Managing complex state and data flows
- Handling asynchronous operations
- UI event processing
- Game state management
- Input handling and processing

## Basic Concepts

R3 follows the ReactiveX pattern with these core components:

- **Observable**: Represents a stream of data or events
- **Observer**: Consumes and reacts to data from Observables
- **Operators**: Transform, combine, and manipulate data streams
- **Subjects**: Act as both Observable and Observer
