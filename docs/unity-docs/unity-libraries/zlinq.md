# ZLinq

## High Performance LINQ for Unity

ZLinq is a zero allocation LINQ implementation designed specifically for Unity, offering better performance compared to traditional LINQ operations. It's particularly useful in game development scenarios where memory allocation and garbage collection need to be minimized.

- [Official ZLinq Documentation](https://github.com/Cysharp/ZLinq)

## Key Features

- Zero/minimal memory allocation
- Higher performance than standard LINQ
- Compatible with existing LINQ syntax
- Specialized for Unity development
- Compile-time type safety
- Built-in optimization for common operations

## When to Use ZLinq

- Processing large collections in performance-critical code
- Real-time data manipulation during gameplay
- Handling frequent collection operations
- Memory-sensitive scenarios
- Game logic requiring collection transformations
- Performance optimization of existing LINQ code

## Advantages Over Standard LINQ

- No boxing/unboxing overhead
- Reduced garbage collection pressure
- Better runtime performance
- Memory-efficient operations
- Unity-specific optimizations
- Familiar LINQ-style syntax
