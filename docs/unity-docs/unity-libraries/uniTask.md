# UniTask

## Zero Allocation Async/Await for Unity

UniTask is a powerful library that provides an efficient zero allocation implementation of async/await for Unity. It's designed to solve the performance and garbage collection issues that come with standard C# async/await operations in Unity.

- [Official UniTask Documentation](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask)

## Key Features

- Zero allocation async/await
- Unity-specific optimizations
- Cancellation support
- Progress reporting
- Integration with Unity's coroutine system
- Custom task schedulers
- PlayerLoop customization

## When to Use UniTask

- Asynchronous operations in games
- Loading and resource management
- Network operations
- UI interactions
- Scene management
- Time-based operations
- Converting coroutines to async/await

## Advantages Over Traditional Async/Await

- No garbage collection overhead
- Better performance in Unity context
- Enhanced compatibility with Unity's systems
- More control over execution timing
- Built-in Unity-specific features
- Simplified error handling
